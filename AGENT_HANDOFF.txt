Any Player Shared Rust Migration - Agent Handoff
Updated: 2026-02-18

Scope completed in this increment
1) Step 0 completed: Android Spotify client ID baseline restored.
   - Changed file:
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-android/app/src/main/java/com/anyplayer/android/core/network/SpotifyClientIds.kt
   - Behavior now uses BuildConfig.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID (app-owned config) instead of the temporary librespot override.

2) Step 1 completed: Shared Rust workspace scaffolded.
   - Root:
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/Cargo.toml
   - Crates created:
     crates/any_player_core
     crates/any_player_spotify_engine
     crates/any_player_ffi_android
   - CI workflow added:
     .github/workflows/ci.yml (runs: cargo check --workspace)
   - Misc:
     .gitignore added for /target and Cargo.lock
     any_player_ffi_android configured with crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

3) Step 2 completed: Portable models and provider contracts moved into any_player_core.
   - Changed files:
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_core/Cargo.toml
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_core/src/lib.rs
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_core/src/models.rs
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_core/src/providers.rs
   - Added shared modules:
     - any_player_core::models (ported from desktop models module)
     - any_player_core::providers
       - ProviderError
       - ProviderAuthRequest / ProviderAuthResponse
       - MusicProvider trait
       - ProviderRegistry + ProviderHandle (platform-agnostic, no keyring/tauri coupling)
    - Compatibility guard:
      - No tauri/keyring/rodio usage in shared crates after Step 2 extraction.

4) Step 3 completed: Provider API contracts and shared HTTP service modules extracted.
   - Changed files:
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_core/Cargo.toml
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_core/src/lib.rs
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_core/src/provider_api.rs
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_core/src/provider_clients/mod.rs
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_core/src/provider_clients/spotify.rs
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_core/src/provider_clients/jellyfin.rs
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_core/src/provider_clients/plex.rs
   - Added shared contracts:
     - any_player_core::provider_api::AuthFlow (platform-owned orchestration boundary)
     - any_player_core::provider_api::ProviderApi (shared provider HTTP/domain interface)
     - any_player_core::provider_api::ProviderConnectionCheck
   - Added shared provider HTTP services:
     - SpotifyApiClient (token validation, playlists, track fetch/search, stream URI mapping)
     - JellyfinApiClient (connection/user resolution, playlists/tracks/search, stream URL/auth headers)
     - PlexApiClient (connection check, playlists/tracks/search parsing and stream URL lookup)
   - Compatibility guard:
     - No tauri/keyring/rodio/cpal/localhost assumptions in shared Step 3 modules.

5) Step 4 completed: Spotify session engine extracted into any_player_spotify_engine.
   - Changed files:
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_spotify_engine/Cargo.toml
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_spotify_engine/src/lib.rs
   - Added shared runtime-agnostic engine primitives:
     - SpotifySessionConfig (injected client_id)
     - SpotifyToken (access/refresh/expiry DTO)
     - SpotifySessionBackend trait (platform-owned backend adapter)
     - SpotifyTokenRefresher trait (platform-owned refresh orchestration)
     - SpotifySessionEngine with lifecycle methods:
       - initialize_with_token(...)
       - refresh_if_needed(...)
       - is_ready()
       - close()
   - Added unit tests validating init/refresh/close flows.
   - Compatibility guard:
     - No Tauri/keyring/rodio/cpal/localhost callback assumptions in any_player_spotify_engine.

6) Step 5 completed: Desktop adapter wired to shared Spotify engine.
   - Changed files:
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player/src-tauri/Cargo.toml
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player/src-tauri/src/playback/spotify_session.rs
   - Desktop integration changes:
     - Added path dependency from desktop app to shared crate:
       any_player_spotify_engine = { path = "../../any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_spotify_engine" }
     - Replaced local session state implementation with thin adapter wrapping shared
       SpotifySessionEngine while keeping existing playback manager call surface:
       - new(client_id)
       - is_initialized()
       - initialize_with_oauth_token(...)
       - get_access_token()
       - get_session()
       - close_session()
     - Implemented DesktopLibrespotBackend for SpotifySessionBackend using librespot Session connect/shutdown.
   - Compatibility guard:
     - Tauri command/websocket/event surface unchanged.

7) Step 6 completed: Android FFI adapter and Kotlin JNI bridge (narrow token/session flow).
   - Changed files (shared rust):
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_ffi_android/Cargo.toml
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_ffi_android/src/lib.rs
   - Added JNI exports (JSON responses):
     - init(config_json)
     - spotifyBeginAuth(config_json)
     - spotifyExchangeCode(code, verifier, redirect) -> structured platform-auth-required error
     - spotifyValidateToken(token_input)
     - spotifyInitSession(token_input)
     - spotifySessionReady()
   - Shared-engine usage in FFI:
     - any_player_ffi_android now uses any_player_spotify_engine through a platform backend adapter
     - global bridge state + runtime for JNI entry points

   - Changed files (android):
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-android/app/src/main/java/com/anyplayer/android/core/rust/RustBridgeNative.kt
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-android/app/src/main/java/com/anyplayer/android/core/rust/RustBridge.kt
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-android/app/src/main/java/com/anyplayer/android/feature/auth/ProviderAuthRepositoryImpl.kt
   - Android integration details:
     - Added System.loadLibrary("any_player_ffi_android") loader with safe availability fallback.
     - Added RustBridge wrapper methods for token validation/session init readiness checks.
     - Wired narrow flow in ProviderAuthRepositoryImpl so Spotify playbackReady uses Rust bridge when available, with Kotlin fallback preserved when JNI is unavailable or bridge call fails.
   - Compatibility guard:
     - Spotify auth orchestration remains platform-owned in Kotlin.
     - No Tauri/keyring/rodio/cpal added to shared crates.

8) Step 7 completed: Android arm64 native artifact wiring + smoke validation hardening.
   - Changed files:
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-android/app/build.gradle.kts
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust/crates/any_player_ffi_android/src/lib.rs
   - Android build wiring:
     - Added Gradle task `buildRustFfiArm64` to compile `any_player_ffi_android` for target `aarch64-linux-android`.
     - Added task `syncRustFfiArm64` to copy `libany_player_ffi_android.so` into:
       /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a
     - Hooked `preBuild` -> `syncRustFfiArm64`.
     - Restricted first ABI rollout to arm64-v8a (`defaultConfig.ndk.abiFilters += "arm64-v8a"`).
   - Smoke checks added in Rust FFI crate:
     - smoke_spotify_token_session_readiness_flow
     - spotify_exchange_code_reports_platform_auth_required
   - Packaging verification:
     - Confirmed debug APK contains `lib/arm64-v8a/libany_player_ffi_android.so`.
   - Compatibility guard:
     - Platform-owned auth orchestration unchanged.
     - JNI fallback path in Kotlin still intact if native lib load fails.

9) Step 8 completed (post-brief hardening): expanded Android Rust FFI ABI coverage to x86_64.
   - Changed files:
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-android/app/build.gradle.kts
   - Build pipeline updates:
     - Added x86_64 Rust build task: `buildRustFfiX8664`
     - Added x86_64 sync task: `syncRustFfiX8664`
     - `preBuild` now depends on both arm64 and x86_64 sync tasks
     - Expanded ABI filters to include `x86_64` alongside `arm64-v8a`
   - Packaging verification:
     - APK now contains both:
       - lib/arm64-v8a/libany_player_ffi_android.so
       - lib/x86_64/libany_player_ffi_android.so

10) Step 9 completed (post-brief hardening): expanded Android Rust FFI ABI coverage to armeabi-v7a and x86.
   - Changed files:
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-android/app/build.gradle.kts
   - Build pipeline updates:
     - Added armv7 Rust build/sync tasks:
       - buildRustFfiArmv7
       - syncRustFfiArmv7
     - Added x86 Rust build/sync tasks:
       - buildRustFfiX86
       - syncRustFfiX86
     - `preBuild` now depends on all four sync tasks (arm64-v8a, x86_64, armeabi-v7a, x86)
     - Expanded ABI filters to include all four ABIs.
   - Packaging verification:
     - APK now contains:
       - lib/arm64-v8a/libany_player_ffi_android.so
       - lib/x86_64/libany_player_ffi_android.so
       - lib/armeabi-v7a/libany_player_ffi_android.so
       - lib/x86/libany_player_ffi_android.so

11) Step 10 completed: cross-project audit against original brief + emulator deployment.
   - Audit scope:
     - /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust
     - /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player
     - /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-android
   - Missed items identified:
     - Desktop still does not consume `any_player_core`; local models/providers remain primary runtime path.
     - Android Rust auth helper exports (`spotifyBeginAuth` / `spotifyExchangeCode`) are present but not wired into auth repository flow (Kotlin remains source of truth).
     - Android fallback in `resolveSpotifyPlaybackReady` returns `true` when Rust bridge is unavailable, which may over-report readiness.
   - Emulator deployment:
     - Built latest debug app via Gradle.
     - Installed to running emulator `emulator-5554` via adb.
     - Launched `com.anyplayer.android/.MainActivity` for manual testing.

12) Step 11 completed: fixed discovered audit gaps across desktop and android.
   - Changed files (desktop):
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player/src-tauri/Cargo.toml
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player/src-tauri/src/models/mod.rs
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player/src-tauri/src/providers/mod.rs
   - Desktop gap fixes:
     - Added dependency on `any_player_core`.
     - Switched desktop models module to shared model re-export (`pub use any_player_core::models::*;`).
     - Switched provider contract exports to shared `any_player_core::providers` types while preserving desktop-specific ProviderRegistry behavior.

   - Changed files (android):
     /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-android/app/src/main/java/com/anyplayer/android/feature/auth/ProviderAuthRepositoryImpl.kt
   - Android gap fixes:
     - Wired Rust helper `spotifyBeginAuth` into begin-auth path (with Kotlin URL fallback).
     - Wired Rust helper `spotifyExchangeCode` into complete-auth path as platform-boundary call before Kotlin exchange.
     - Fixed readiness fallback to conservative behavior: Rust bridge unavailability now yields `playbackReady = false` instead of implicit true.
   - Emulator deployment:
     - Reinstalled updated debug APK to `emulator-5554`.
     - Relaunched `com.anyplayer.android/.MainActivity`.

Important context for next agent
- Keep scope incremental per migration brief.
- Steps 0-7 from the migration brief are implemented in this environment.
- Likely next work items are follow-up hardening:
  - replace additional Kotlin-only Spotify/session surfaces with shared Rust FFI incrementally
  - add richer integration tests around OAuth/login roundtrip and session readiness transitions
  - reduce duplicated Gradle Rust task wiring by consolidating ABI matrix build logic (optional cleanup)
  - integrate `any_player_core` into desktop runtime path (providers/models) to complete core sharing intent
  - integrate `any_player_core` deeper into desktop provider implementation internals (current fix moved shared contracts/models, registry remains desktop-specific)
- Neither /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-android nor /home/nesbitt/Desktop/any-player-shared-rust is a git repository in this environment, so no PR was opened here.
